## Introduction
Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are a powerful feature in SQL Server that allows you to define temporary result sets that can be referenced within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. CTEs improve readability and maintainability of complex queries, making SQL code easier to understand and manage.

## Basic Syntax of CTE
A CTE is defined using the `WITH` keyword followed by the CTE name and the query defining the result set. You can reference the CTE within the main query as if it were a table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
WITH cte_name (column1, column2, ...)
AS
(
    -- CTE query
    SELECT ...
)
-- Main query using CTE
SELECT ...
FROM cte_name;
```

## Types of CTEs

### Simple CTE
A simple CTE is a single, non-recursive query that can be used to simplify complex SQL queries by breaking them into logical parts.

### Recursive CTE
A recursive CTE references itself and is used for queries that involve hierarchical data, such as organizational charts or tree structures. It consists of an anchor member and a recursive member.

**Syntax for Recursive CTE:**
```sql
WITH cte_name (column1, column2, ...)
AS
(
    -- Anchor member
    SELECT ...
    UNION ALL
    -- Recursive member
    SELECT ...
    FROM cte_name
    WHERE ...
)
SELECT ...
FROM cte_name;
```

## Use Cases for CTEs
- Simplifying complex queries by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- Creating recursive queries for hierarchical data, such as employee-manager relationships.
- Performing operations that require multiple passes over the data, like calculating running totals or cumulative sums.
- Making the SQL code more readable and maintainable, especially in scenarios with multiple joins or nested subqueries.

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple CTE
This example demonstrates the basic use of a CTE to simplify a query that selects employees with salaries above a certain threshold.

```sql
WITH HighSalaries AS
(
    SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Salary > 60000
)
SELECT *
FROM HighSalaries;
```

**Explanation:** The CTE `HighSalaries` selects employees with salaries greater than 60,000, and the main query retrieves all the columns from this CTE.

### Example 2: Recursive CTE for Hierarchical Data
This example shows how to use a recursive CTE to retrieve all employees in an organizational hierarchy starting from a specific manager.

```sql
WITH EmployeeHierarchy AS
(
    -- Anchor member: Select the manager
    SELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID, FirstName, LastName, 0 AS Level
    FROM Employees
    WHERE ManagerID IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive member: Select employees reporting to the current level
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.ManagerID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, eh.Level + 1
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.ManagerID = eh.EmployeeID
)
SELECT *
FROM EmployeeHierarchy
ORDER BY Level, EmployeeID;
```

**Explanation:** The CTE `EmployeeHierarchy` starts with the top-level manager and recursively selects all employees reporting to each level.

### Example 3: CTE with Multiple Expressions
This example demonstrates how to define and use multiple CTEs in a single query.

```sql
WITH SalesData AS
(
    SELECT SalesPersonID, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY SalesPersonID
),
HighSales AS
(
    SELECT SalesPersonID, TotalSales
    FROM SalesData
    WHERE TotalSales > 100000
)
SELECT *
FROM HighSales;
```

**Explanation:** The first CTE `SalesData` aggregates sales by salesperson, and the second CTE `HighSales` filters out salespeople with total sales greater than 100,000.

### Example 4: Using CTEs with INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
CTEs can also be used in conjunction with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations.

```sql
WITH TopSalespeople AS
(
    SELECT SalesPersonID
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY SalesPersonID
    HAVING SUM(SalesAmount) > 100000
)
UPDATE Employees
SET Bonus = 5000
WHERE EmployeeID IN (SELECT SalesPersonID FROM TopSalespeople);
```

**Explanation:** This example updates the `Bonus` column for employees who are top salespeople based on their sales performance.

## CTE vs Temporary Tables vs Subqueries
- **CTEs:** Ideal for readability and recursive queries. They are more straightforward for complex, nested queries and are only valid for the statement they are defined in.
- **Temporary Tables:** Useful for complex operations across multiple queries. They persist for the session and can store large intermediate results.
- **Subqueries:** Can be more concise but harder to read and maintain, especially with deep nesting. Subqueries are best for simple, one-off transformations.

## Best Practices and Limitations
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use CTEs to break down complex queries into more readable parts.
  - Utilize recursive CTEs for hierarchical data.
  - Keep CTEs focused and avoid excessive complexity within a single CTE.

- **Limitations:**
  - CTEs are only valid for the duration of the statement they are defined in.
  - Recursive CTEs can be performance-intensive, especially with deep recursion or large data sets.
  - SQL Server imposes a limit of 32767 recursions for a recursive CTE.

## Conclusion
CTEs are a versatile and powerful feature in SQL Server that help simplify complex queries, improve readability, and handle recursive data structures efficiently. Understanding when and how to use CTEs can significantly enhance the quality and maintainability of your SQL code.
